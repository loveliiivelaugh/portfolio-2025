            My approach to API development leverages Python or JavaScript as the primary programming language, utilizing frameworks such as Express or Hono for building robust web services. I emphasize quality and reliability by implementing comprehensive tests with Vitest, ensuring test coverage exceeds 90%. To maintain optimal performance and reliability, I monitor API health through Uptime Komo.
            APIs are thoroughly documented using Swagger, providing both interactive documentation and an OpenAPI schema in JSON format for clear and accessible integration. For security, I implement Cloudflare for protection against threats and leverage Auth0 for secure authentication and authorization.
            Additionally, I support both GraphQL and RESTful APIs, offering flexible options for clients based on their specific needs.

                <h2>What are API's and why do we need them?</h2>
                <p>
                    Application Programming Interface. This is a software layer that developers voluntarily build so that two separate softwares have a means of communicating with each other. This is how we build our API's. This is also how we consume the API's of other service's that are publicly available. Some of these include <Keyword>Google's suite of API's</Keyword>, Salesforce's API's, OpenAI, APIMarketPlace, Nutritionix, and many more. See this doc for a comprehensive list of API's found all over the open internet. All of our API development comes equipped with interactive documentation, written documentation, unit tests, integration tests, and security to ensure the API's we build are performant and secure. We build API's in the RESTful and GraphQL protocols. Here are some example's üëâ

                <img src={apiDiagramImage} alt="API diagram" style={{ width: "800px", border: '2px solid #ccc' }} />
                <p>A popular trend in the marketplace today is to use tools like <Keyword>Zapier</Keyword> to achieve these integrations</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>How do we do automation?</h2>
                <a href="https://n8n.io/">n8n</a>
                <p>
                    Using a few different tools that are available in the marketplace today. Some of these include the popular tool <Keyword>n8n</Keyword>. We host our own instance of n8n and we use code and programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, and automated Bash scripts. Using these tools in combination with the available API's in the marketplace, the ability to build automation's is endless!
                    Some other notable technologies include Process Builder within the Salesforce eco system, and other mainstream low-code or no code tools like Zapier or make.com. If there is not an API available for a specific integration, then it is possible to explore custom web scraping solutions following all legal obligations.

                <h2>AI Integrations?</h2>
                <p>
                    Technology is moving faster and faster especially today. AI is almost everywhere we look now a days and this is most likely only the very beginning of the age of AI. At Cherrytopframework we embrace AI as a tool that can be used to help us grow our business and help us improve our work allowing us to be more accurate and efficient. There are plenty of paid AI services available in the marketplace today such as <Keyword>OpenAI's</Keyword> ChatGPT, Claude, Google's Gemini, and many more. One of the ways that we can use these services is through the API's these companies make available to developers to use in creative ways. We are happy to build these custom AI integrations in our platform. Aside from these paid services, we also offer our own hosted AI services that allow for more flexibility in cost, and in other ways. One of the tools that we use to do this is with <Keyword>Ollama</Keyword>.

//                     Self hosting is the process of running your own server and hosting your own software. We provide a fully end to end service to set up private hosting for you, your home, or your business. Self hosting enables you to have full control over your own server, and to have full control over your own software. Software that is available to you when using your own hosting solutions are open source and can easily replace most if not all paid enterprise software that is commonly used for business. Self-hosting also enables using <Keyword>Home Assistant</Keyword> the most advanced open source home automation platform. This runs on your own server using your own resources so you will benefit from full privacy, security, and autonomy over your own data. Home Assistant can be integrated with Ollama to completely replace Alexa privately for free (outside of the maintenance costs of your own server) while being upgraded with AI. (Which we could connect to the internet or other IoT devices for free) There are countless more opportunities unlocked when self-hosting. Refer to this document for a comprehensive list of open source software that can be hosted with your own server for free.

//                     The answer to this really varies. At the foundation we are essentially borrowing resources from another computer (server). Depending on how many computers you have and how many cores you have, the cost will vary. Also depending on what kind of software you want to run and how many active users that will be connecting to the services among other things. High performance AI requires a lot of resources, specifically compute.
