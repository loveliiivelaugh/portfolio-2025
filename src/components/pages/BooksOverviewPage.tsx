            So far discussing Croesus, King of Lydia, and how he lost his kingdom to Cryus the Great of Persia. 
            Discussed how Croesus thinks he is the most fortunate and tries to get Solon to agree to this. 
            Talks to the Oracle of Delphi and assumes an understanding of a prophecy he received.
            Unfortonately Croesus interpeted the prophecy incorrectly.
            Before the prophecy could fully come to pass Croesus newly wedded son gets killed on accident by Astratos (might be wrong about the name)
            Astratos is the son of King Gordias who is the son of King Midas (Golden Touch King Midas)
            Shortly after Croesus attempts to conquer Persia.
            Loses a battle with Persia and then they invade Lydia
            The Persians take Croesus captive.
            Cyrus and Croesus become friends
